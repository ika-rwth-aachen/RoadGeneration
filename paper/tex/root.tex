\section{INTRODUCTION}

To assure the safety of automated driving functions (ADF), verification and validation methods need to developed and established. (testfahrten und nötige km. etc erklären. zu Szenarien und simulation überleiten)

One approach to reach this state is scenario based testing. [ref] proposed different stages of scenarios: functional, logical and concrete. The term functional states a linguistic description which allows experts to talk about scenarios at an early stage of the development process. In logical scenarios parameters and ideally their probability distributions are provided. Finally, concrete scenarios specify a distinct value for each parameter which makes them feasible to be executed reproducible in a simulation or on proving grounds. Each stage can be divided into six levels (ref. EN layer ,hendrik) where the three lower layers describe the static part of the scenario, i.e. the road. Layer four focuses on moving objects, whereas layer five and six describe environmental conditions and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, respectively. Detailed discussion in [ref hendrik eindhoven] (oder schreibt man das nicht?)

Current research initiatives such as SET Level 4to5 (footnote?) address simulative scenario based testing with focus on inner city traffic. Besides layer four which describes the dynamic behavior of all participants, the static scenery has to be taken into account as well. The latter is described within layer one to three and has to be defined in a logical and concrete manner, respectively. The open source standard format OpenDRIVE [ref asam] is suitable for concrete descriptions of road networks and is widely used in industry and research. However, by now there is no standardized logical road description format which is easy to use and capable to be transfered into OpenDRIVE. 

This article introduces a prototypical logical description language for complex road networks and a tool which generates concrete, standardized OpenDRIVE maps which may be used for the simulative testing of ADF. An example which outlines the idea of the concept is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_motivation}

\section{RELATED WORK}
During the research initiative PEGASUS [ref] these concepts have been developed and utilized within the domain German motorway. Furthermore, the main focus has been on layer four. Nevertheless, when moving the testing domain to inner city scenarios such as the driving behavior on intersections, layers one to three are much more complex. Motorways usually consist of parallel lanes which follow curves with big radii. Such a road is not complicated to describe and generate. It can be done automatically with low effort. [ref. menzel et al.] propose a method to create a standardized road network in the OpenDRIVE format from a logical (and functional) road description. However, inner city intersections are more complex both in the logical description and in terms of the concrete format.

\section{METHODOLOGY}
The concept presented in this paper aims to offer a description for road networks which allows easy modifications of the map due to a non-redundant design. Further, it is possible to provide limited information for intersections and lane definitions since some default configurations for main and access roads are defined. The input shall be translated into a concrete standardized road description format. With the logical description comes a road generation tool that calculates all required OpenDRIVE quantities from the simplified input. We use XML to store the input and the corresponding OpenDRIVE output is saved in XML as well. This way we attempt to close a gap in the pipeline of defining logical scenarios on intersections and make them executable in a concrete manner.

\section{LOGICAL ROAD DESCRIPTION}
The proposed logical road description is derived from the reference line concept used in OpenDRIVE [ref]. This means that each lane is described by an offset from a reference line defined in the $x,y$-plane (topview). However, in contrast to OpenDRIVE we introduce some simplifications and eliminate redundancies along the reference line. Each road segment consists of the geometric primitives line, arc and spiral, which is motivated by the federal guidelines for road constructions [ref]. A simplified illustration of the road network's XML structure is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_schema}. On the first level under the \textit{roadNetwork} tag all segments are defined and links which connect them can be stated. In addition, "loose ends" of segments can be automatically connected within the \textit{closeRoadNetwork} tag. As illustrated, segments might be T-/X-junctions, roundabouts and connection roads. 

In the following sections, the refernce line is examined more detailed, followed by the description of the input for the logical road network concept. The documentation is based on the nodes shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_schema}. 
\begin{figure}[thpb] 		
	\centering
	\includegraphics{fig/schema.pdf}
	\caption{Hierarchical structure of the road network. On the first level all segments and their relation to each other are defined. In addition, it is possible to define the automatic connection of two road ends. Segments are defined as roundabouts, junctions and connection roads. $r_i$ and $I$ describe roads and intersection definitions, respectively}
	\label{fig_schema}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Reference Lines} % or find better heading
In order to ensure a smooth driveability along the road network, we define that the curvature has to be continuous along roads (where curvature is defined as the reciprocal of the radius). Therefor, the definition of curvature over distance, a start point and initial heading is sufficient to uniquely describe a road's course. This, at the same time implies that in contrast to OpenDRIVE it is not necessary to state the start point and heading of each geometric primitive. Fig.~\ref{fig_curvGraph} shows the definition of a road segment that is composed of the geometric primitive sequence line-spiral-arc-spiral-line.

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_curvGraph}, the curvature $\kappa(s)$ is a piecewise linear defined function over distance. Since we use lines, spirals and arcs, three definitions for those pieces are required. A line is described by $\kappa(s) = 0$ which means, only a length $L$ needs to be specified. An arc's course is defined by a constant curvature $\kappa(s) = \kappa_\text{arc} = \text{const}$. Therefor, an arc is defined by a length $L$ and a radius $R$. Note that we use radii in the input description because they are more intuitive than the curvature. Finally, a spiral is characterized by a linear change of curvature: $\kappa(s) = a s$, where $a$ is constant (for details on spirals cf. [ref]). Consequently, in addition to the length $L$, the start and end radius $R_s$ and $R_e$ need to be defined for a spiral to be unique. Those definitions are then being concatenated to a curvature graph and result in an unambiguous road course in the $x,y$-plane if either the initial values for position and orientation at the start are provided or the road is connected to another segment without a curvature jump.

%% maths prob. later, better describe input
%If the initial values $\phi_\text{0}, x_\text{0}, y_\text{0}$ are provided, the plan view coordinates can be calculated as follows:
%\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
%\begin{split}
%\phi(s) &= \int_0^s \kappa(\hat{s}) d\hat{s} + \phi_\text{0} \\ 
%x(s) &= \int_{0}^{s} \cos(\phi(\hat{s})) d\hat{s} + x_\text{0} \\ 
%y(s) &= \int_{0}^{s} \sin(\phi(\hat{s})) d\hat{s} + y_\text{0} \\
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}

	\label{fig_curvGraph}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Segements}
Below, the segments which might be defined in the road network input are described starting with connections roads, followed by junctions and roundabouts.

Connection roads consist of single \textit{road} tags defined by a reference line and definition for lanes and signals in the $s,t$-coordinate system. The latter is a moving coordinate system along the distance $s$. The $t$-coordinate is defined as the offset parallel to the reference line at position $s$. Lane extension and merging follow 3rd degree polynomials which are stated by their start and end point in $s,t$-coordinates, the corresponding polynomial coefficients are calculated by the road generation tool.

At least two and at most three \textit{road} entities are required to create a T-junction. Often one road is the dominant or main road in an intersection, which can be exploited by defining it as a single road that is intersected by an access road (cf. Fig.~\ref{fig_juncDef}). Alternatively, three single roads can be combined to form a T-junction by defining one reference road and the angles at which the other two roads are connected. In addition to topological information of the junction, it is possible to define the intersection area more detailed. First, for each road arm the distance from the intersection point to the beginning of the junction can be specified. The latter means the point where turning lanes start to leave the course of the reference line. Fig.~\ref{fig_createJunction} c) shows such an intersection area. Furthermore, additional lanes for left and right turns can be added ad libitum (\textit{verrückter ausdruck für "nach Belieben"}). Those lanes are specified by their minimal radius, the concrete course is calculated automatically. The descriptions of T- and X-junctions are a lot alike and thus X-junctions can be created analogously to the preceding paragraph about T-junctions.

	\centering
	\includegraphics{fig/junctionDef.pdf}	
	\caption{Two roads are coupled to form a T-junction. Road 1 is defined as an arc by length and curvature whereas road 2 is a straight line with length $L_l$. On both roads the intersection point along $s$ is defined. In addition, the angle $\alpha$ at this point is stated. }

\section{ROAD GENERATION / IMPLEMENTATION}

\subsection{Geometry}
    Each road network consists of a collection of many different roads. The most important component of a road is its reference line, which clearly defines the shape and length of the road employing an analytical description. Straight lines, arcs, and spirals are considered as segments of the reference line. Each segment is defined by a starting point and angle, as well as the curvature of the road. In order to get the coordinates and orientation along \(s\), a transformation, depending on the geometry type, is necessary. For a straight line, the following trivial equations result.
    \begin{equation}
        \varphi = \varphi_0, \quad x = s \cdot \cos(\varphi_0), \quad y = s \cdot \sin(\varphi_0)
    \end{equation}

    With a segment of a circle, however, the orientation also changes along \(s\). With the curvature \(\kappa\) this results in:
    \begin{equation}
        \varphi = s  \kappa + \varphi_0, \quad x = \frac{1}{\kappa} \left(\sin\varphi - \sin\varphi_0 \right),  y = \frac{1}{\kappa} \left(\cos\varphi_0 - \cos\varphi \right) 
    \end{equation} 

    For a spiral the coordinates along s can be described with a parameter \(a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2R_1s_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{\kappa_1}{2s_1}}\) and the following equations. 
    \begin{equation} 
        x = \frac{1}{a}\int_0^{as}  \cos\left(t^2\right)dt, \quad y = \frac{1}{a}\int_0^{as}  \sin\left(t^2\right)dt 
    \end{equation}

    These integrals can finally be approximated with a series, so-called Fresnel integrals since they have no analytical solution. This power series can be cut off after a few terms, still leading good results.
    % is it relevant? 

    In a further step, lanes are added to the reference line. Each is described by a lane type, a marking, and especially by a width, which can be varied over road length \(s\) and is unambiguously described by a third-order polynomial with coefficients \(a,b,c,d\). In the simplest case, a constant road width \(w\) results in \(a=b=c=0, d=w\). If a lane widening occurs at point \(s_0\), the lane width increases from zero to the final width \(b\) over a given length \(ds\). Additional conditions for modeling the four polynomial coefficients are continuous transitions \(\left(f'(s) = 0\right)\) at start and end of the widening \(s_0\) and \(s_0 + ds\) respectively. This results in the following coefficients.

    \begin{equation}
        a = -2\frac{w}{ds^3}, \quad b=3 \frac{w}{ds^2}, \quad c=0 , \quad d=0   
    \end{equation}
        
\subsection{Intersections}
    \begin{figure}[thpb]        
        \centering
        \includegraphics{fig/createJunction.pdf}
        \caption{From logical definition to concrete intersection. After the reference lines are in the correct position a), corresponding lanes are generated (b). Subsequently, the intersection area is cut free (c) and all required connection lanes are generated automatically (d). \textbf{grafik ok so...?}}
        \label{fig_createJunction}
    \end{figure}

    In a road network, besides roads, there are also intersections, which can appear as T- or X-intersection as well as roundabouts. Each of them is specified in a separate tag in the input file and consists, as shown in Fig.~ \ref{fig_schema}, of intersection information \(I\) as well as the corresponding roads \(r_i\). With this information, the intersection center is entirely specified by the roads $s$-coordinates of the intersection and the angles to the reference road (cf. Fig.~\ref{fig_juncDef}). Furthermore, a coupler tag exists, which defines the intersection area with its traffic lanes in more detail. Besides the size of the intersection area, it also specifies which lanes of the individual roads are connected or whether additional lanes are added before the intersection.

    The segment is constructed such that the junction midpoint lies in the origin and intersects the reference road without any angle. Further roads intersect the origin at road position \(s_I\) at a defined angle \(\varphi_I\), so that the starting point and the starting angle of each geometry of this road must be shifted by a translatory offset \(\tilde{x}, \tilde{y}\) and rotated around the angle \(\tilde{\varphi} = \varphi_I\). The translatory offset can be determined from the coordinates at position \(s_I\) so that all segments with their starting points \(x_0,y_0,\varphi_0\) can be transformed as follows.

    \begin{align} \label{eq2}
        \begin{split}
            x &= \cos(\tilde{\varphi}) \left(x_0-\tilde{x}\right) - \sin(\tilde{\varphi}) \left(y_0-\tilde{y}\right) \\
            y &= \sin(\tilde{\varphi}) \left(x_0-\tilde{x}\right) + \cos(\tilde{\varphi}) \left(y_0-\tilde{y}\right) \\
            \varphi &= \varphi_0 + \tilde{\varphi} \\
        \end{split}
    \end{align}

    For inserting new connecting roads, the junction area has to be cut, which requires a cut in each reference line of the roads. \(s_I\) bezeichnet dabei den Punkt im Kreuzungsmittelpunkt und \(s_A\) den Kreuzungsbereich. Aus der definierten Referenzlinie werden nun zwei Teilstücke extrahiert, zum einen der Teil bis zum beginn der kreuzung \((-\inf,s_I - s_A]\), sowie der Teil hinter der Kreuzung \([s_I + s_A, \inf)\). Die zwei relevanten Stellen der Referenzlinie werden nun also iterativ über alle Geometrien kopiert um die neuen Ausgangsstraßen der Kreuzung zu generieren. Je nach Schnitt auf Gerade, Kreisbogen oder Spirale muss das jeweile Segment der Referenzlinie angepasst werden.
    
    %Iterating over all geometries can result in four different cases, as seen in Figure \ref{fig_geometryCut}. 
    %\begin{figure}[]    
    %    \includegraphics[width= \columnwidth]{fig/geometryCut.pdf}
    %    \caption{possible cases for reference line cutting}
    %    \label{fig_geometryCut}
    %\end{figure}

    %For case a), the starting cut takes place in the geometry so that the new start point is calculated first, and then the geometry is adjusted concerning length and starting curvature. Similarly, in case of b), the end cut is made, which changes the length and, in case of a spiral, the end curvature of the geometry, respectively. In the third case c), both cuts are made in the current geometry so that the start point, as well as the length and the curvatures, are adjusted. In the fourth case d), no cut is performed, so the current geometry remains unchanged.

    After every street is cut and correctly positioned, the next step is calculating the reference lines of the lanes inside of the intersection area. Each lane is generated as an individual street with its reference line, whereby the single-lane lies to the right of the reference line. Based on starting point \(A\) and endpoint \(B\) as well as the angles \(\varphi_{A}\) and \(\varphi_{B}\) the new reference line of a lane is calculated. As a simplification, only straight lines and arcs are used since the discontinuity in the curvature can be neglected at low speeds. In the first step, the endpoints are extended with straight lines to calculate the intersecting point \(I\). 
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            I_x &= \frac{B_y - A_y + \left(\tan(\varphi_A) A_x - \tan(\varphi_B) B_x\right)}{\tan(\varphi_A) - \tan(\varphi_B)} \\
            I_y &= \tan(\varphi_A) \cdot I_x + \left(A_y - \tan(\varphi_A) A_x\right)\\
        \end{split}     
    \end{align}

    The euclidean distances between endpoints \(A\), \(B\) and intersection point \(d_A, d_B\) can be determined from this. In the following, the line with further distance is extended until the new distances are equal, which introduces the new helping point \(H\) at the end of the extended line. In a last step, the two points are connected by an arc with radius \(r\) and length \(l\). The following equation determines the parameters of the circle, where \(\alpha = \varphi_B - \varphi_A\). A visualization of the process is provided in Figure~\ref{fig_connecting_road}.

    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}           
        r &= \frac{\sqrt{\left(H_x - A_x\right)^2 + \left(H_y - A_y\right)^2}}{2 \cdot \sin\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)} \\
        l &= \vert r \cdot \left(\varphi_B - \varphi_A\right) \vert \\  
        \end{split}
    \end{align}

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
